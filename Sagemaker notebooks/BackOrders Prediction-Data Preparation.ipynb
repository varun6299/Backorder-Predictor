    "## About the Topic\n",
    "A backorder is an item that is not in stock at the moment. The customer can still order it, but delivery will only happen once the stock has been replenished. This is different from a situation when a product is labeled as being “out-of-stock” on the web platform which means the customer can’t order the product. However, backorders can still be placed despite the product not being in stock at a given moment in time. However, this causes a lot of additional inventory costs and wait for the customers, which is undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The aim is to create a prediction model largely to identify whether items could be going out of stock or on backorder. This will help us to keep adequate or surplus stock of those products in order to meet demands of customers and not lose sales opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "The list of all features and explanation of certain features (only unknown or technical jargons) in the features given the dataset have been provided below :\n",
    "- **sku** : a stock keeping unit is a distinct type of item for sale, such as a product or service, and all attributes associated with the item type that distinguish it from other item types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **national_inv**: The present inventory level of the product\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lead_time** :  lead time in inventory management is the amount of time between when a purchase order is placed to replenish products and when the order is received in the warehouse. Order lead times can vary between suppliers; the more suppliers involved in the chain, the longer the lead time is likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **in_transit_qty** : In transit inventory, also called transportation inventory or goods in transit, is any good shipped by a seller but not yet received by a buyer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **forecast_3_month** : Forecasted sales of the product for the next 3 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **forecast_6_month** : Forecasted sales of the product for the next 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **forecast_9_month** : Forecasted sales of the product for the next 9 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales_1_month** : Actual Sales of the product in the last 1 month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales_3_month** : Actual Sales of the product in the last 3 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales_6_month** : Actual Sales of the product in the last 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales_9_month** : Actual Sales of the product in the last 9 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_bank**: Minimum amount of stock recommended to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **potential_issue**: Any problem identified with the product or part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pieces_past_due** : Assumption - The stock items that have been kept in stock for long time, past their expected life span.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **perf_6_month_avg** : Average sales performance of product over last 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **perf_12_month_avg**: Average sales performance of product over last 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **local_bo_qty** : BO QTY in inventory managment refers to the Back Order Quantity. To find Back Order Quantity, divide the number of undeliverable orders by the total number of orders and multiply the result by 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **deck_risk** : Assumption - It is the risk associated with keeping the items in stock and could relate to damage, shelf life, theft, etc. \n",
    "- oe_constraint\n",
    "- **ppap_risk** : Short for Production Part Approval Process, it is a risk reduction process which is used as a risk classification and qualification process which is used to determine whether a production run will produce parts with consistency and repeatability. It is done prior to product release\n",
    "- **stop_auto_buy** : Has the auto buy for the product, which was back ordered, cancelled.\n",
    "- rev_stop\n",
    "\n",
    "**TARGET FEATURE** : went_on_backorder - Whether an items was backordered or not"
